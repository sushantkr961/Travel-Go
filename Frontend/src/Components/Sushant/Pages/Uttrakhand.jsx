                KUMBH MELA: LEAP OF FAITH
              </chakra.h5>

              One of the largest human gatherings in the world, Kumbh Mela is a congregation of millions of people who assemble at the banks of the sacred Ganges to take a dip in its holy waters. While some believe it will wash away their sins, others consider it to be the biggest celebration of life. Recognizing the festival's importance, UNESCO included the Kumbh Mela on its Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity list in December 2017. The four venues where Kumbh Mela is held on a rotational basis are Haridwar, Ujjain, Prayagraj, and Nashik. Held every four years, each of these venues witnesses the mela once in 12 years. The Ardh Kumbh, taking place once in six years, is held in Prayagraj and Haridwar. We tell you what makes visiting a Kumbh Mela once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.The main purpose of people coming to Kumbh Mela is for the scared bath. While the whole period is considered auspicious, there are certain days said to be royal and scared than others. On these days, be ready to brace the crowd as thousands of devotees from across cities flock to Haridwar for a holy dip.
