              Kaziranga National Park (KNP) is located in the floodplain of the Brahmaputra River in the Nagoan, Golaghat and Sonitpur districts of Assam, India sprawl over an area of 1030 square kilometers and it is the largest protected region on southern bank of the Brahmaputra River. As far as the terrain of the park is concerned it is flat (approx 55-75 above sea level) with an east to west inclination. Since the park area is the part of the floodplain of the Brahmaputra River the soil of the park is rich in alluvial deposits (sandy loam to clay).Almost after many decades of efforts and experiments, Kaziranga National Park has become a well-known example of the success of wildlife conservation. As a outcome of sustained conservation endeavor, the estimated number of rhinoceros has significantly increased from just 40 in 1911 to more than 2400 in the year 2018 according to the census which was jointly conducted by the forest department of the Government of the Assam and some recognized wildlife NGOs. The sad part of the story are floods that occurs annually which is spread over Nagoan, Golaghat and Sonitpur districts of Assam and covers an area of little more than a thousand square kilometers (482 square kilometers of core zone and 548 square kilometers of buffer zone).
